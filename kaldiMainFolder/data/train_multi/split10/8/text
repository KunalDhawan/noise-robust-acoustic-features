409c020c LIKE AN ASSET SALE BUT UNLIKE A TAX A USER FEE DOES NOT INVOLVE COMPULSION
409c020d ONE CHARACTERISTIC OF USER FEES IS THAT THEY REVEAL HOW MUCH GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS ARE REALLY WORTH TO DIRECT RECIPIENTS IN THE MOST DIRECT AND MEANINGFUL WAY POSSIBLE
409c020e ONE OF THE STRONGEST ARGUMENTS THAT A GOVERNMENT PROGRAM IS WORTHWHILE OCCURS WHEN IT HAS A USER FEE AND THE FEE COVERS COSTS

409c021b ANOTHER IS IF THE FEDERAL RESERVE EASES INTEREST RATES
409c021c AND A THIRD IS IF GEORGE BUSH WINS THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION
409c021d THAT STRATEGY BROUGHT C. S. F. B. HEAD ON WITH THE INCREASINGLY GLOBAL ORIENTATION OF FIRST BOSTON WHICH ALSO WANTED TO DO GLOBAL UNDERWRITING AND MERGERS
