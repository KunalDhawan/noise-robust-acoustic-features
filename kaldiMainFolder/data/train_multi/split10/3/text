01lc0201 THE REVIEW COMMITTEE TRIES TO OFFER A MENU OF SMALL MEDIUM AND LARGE CAPITALIZATION STOCKS
01lc0202 SOME OF ITS MOST SUCCESSFUL PICKS WERE QUITE SMALL COMPANIES WHEN FIRST RECOMMENDED
01lc0203 MONEY MANAGERS MINDING BILLION DOLLAR PORTFOLIOS ON THE OTHER HAND OFTEN AVOID SMALLER STOCKS BECAUSE THEY CAN'T PURCHASE A SIGNIFICANT STAKE WITHOUT AFFECTING THE PRICE
01lc0204 STILL EVEN A MAJOR SLOWDOWN COULD PERMIT HEFTY FUND GROWTH CONSIDERING LAST YEAR'S RECORD GROSS SALES TO INVESTORS OF TWO HUNDRED SIXTEEN BILLION DOLLARS
01lc0205 NET NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX SALES AFTER REDEMPTIONS WERE ONE HUNDRED FORTY EIGHT POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS
01lc0206 A SPOT SURVEY HERE SHOWED THAT MANY EXECUTIVES THINK BOTH GROSS AND NET SALES FOR THE INDUSTRY THIS YEAR MAY RANGE FROM FLAT TO DOWN THIRTY PERCENT FROM LAST YEAR
01lc0207 A LOSS WASN'T UNEXPECTED GIVEN CONTINENTAL'S OPERATIONAL DIFFICULTIES THAT DEVELOPED IN THE QUARTER
01lc0208 HOWEVER THE RESULTS OF TEXAS AIR'S SUBSIDIARIES ARE THE REVERSE OF WHAT MANY ANALYSTS HAD PREDICTED EARLIER IN THE YEAR
01lc0209 INSTEAD OF A MODEST PROFIT AT LOW COST CONTINENTAL BY THE SECOND QUARTER THE NEWLY EXPANDED UNIT HAS STRUGGLED WITH LOSSES
01lc020a ITS HIGHER COST SISTER EASTERN AIRLINES HAS SHOWN SIGNS OF FINANCIAL PROGRESS DESPITE CONTINUING CONFRONTATIONS WITH ITS EMPLOYEE UNIONS
01lc020b HUMANA TRIED TO DEFEND ITSELF THROUGH DIVERSIFICATION AS DID THE OTHER LARGE CHAINS HOSPITAL CORPORATION OF AMERICA AMERICAN MEDICAL INTERNATIONAL INCORPORATED AND NATIONAL MEDICAL ENTERPRISES INCORPORATED
01lc020c THE IDEA WAS THAT IF A HOSPITAL OWNER ALSO HAD AN INSURANCE PLAN IT COULD STEER PATIENTS TO ITS INSTITUTIONS THROUGH FINANCIAL INCENTIVES
01lc020d THE PATIENT POOL MIGHT SHRINK BUT THE COMPANY COULD GRAB A BIGGER PART OF IT
01lc020e THE BLACKSTONE FUND BLACKSTONE CAPITAL PARTNERS L. P. IS SEEKING TO RAISE ONE BILLION DOLLARS
01lc020f IT HAS ALREADY GATHERED SIX HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS TO SEVEN HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FUND OFFICIALS SAID
01lc020g THE FUND'S LIMITED PARTNERS INCLUDE SOME OF THE LARGEST MOST POWERFUL CORPORATIONS IN THE WORLD SAID PETER G. PETERSON BLACKSTONE GROUP'S CHAIRMAN
01lc020h IN JULY AND AUGUST U. S. G. OFFERED EARLY RETIREMENT INCENTIVES THAT RESULTED IN THE ELIMINATION OF MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED MOSTLY SALARIED POSITIONS
01lc020i THE INCENTIVES RESULTED IN A NINE POINT NINE MILLION DOLLAR PRETAX CHARGE AGAINST THIRD QUARTER EARNINGS
01lc020j THE POSITIONS ELIMINATED THROUGH EARLY RETIREMENT ARE EXPECTED TO REDUCE OVERHEAD IN FUTURE YEARS BY SEVEN POINT SIX MILLION DOLLARS THE COMPANY SAID
01lc020k NORTHGATE DECLINED TO ESTIMATE THE SIZE OF AN EXPECTED GAIN ON THE SALE
01lc020l THE COMPANY SAID NET PROCEEDS OF ABOUT ONE HUNDRED THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS WILL BE MAINLY USED TO FINANCE GOLD MINING ACQUISITIONS
01lc020m NORTHGATE SAID IT WILL SEEK PURE GOLD MINES ONLY
01lc020n NEITHER MR. CULLINANE NOR MR. CHAPMAN WHO ALSO IS FIFTY THREE COULD BE REACHED FOR COMMENT
01lc020o WESTWOOD MASSACHUSETTS BASED CULLINET DISCLOSED THE ACTION IN RESPONSE TO QUESTIONS
01lc020p IT SAID IT PLANNED A FORMAL ANNOUNCEMENT TODAY
01lc020q S. D. I. DESPITE WHAT THE DEFENSE LUDDITES SAY IS NOT AN ADVENTURE IN TECHNOLOGY APPLICATION
01lc020r IT IS A TOOL OF NATIONAL POLICY AND AS WITH ANY TOOL IT IS SUPPOSED TO BE USED WITH A SPECIFIC OBJECTIVE IN MIND
01lc020s THE OBJECTIVE LEST WE FORGET IT IS TO PREVENT A GLOBAL NUCLEAR WAR
01lc020t WITHIN AN HOUR BARCLAYS P. L. C. LLOYDS BANK P. L. C. AND THE LONDON UNIT OF CITICORP INCREASED THEIR BASE RATES
01lc020u THE BARCLAYS BOOST TOOK EFFECT IMMEDIATELY WHILE THE OTHER TWO BANKS' MOVES WERE EFFECTIVE AT THE CLOSE OF BUSINESS
01lc020v SIMILAR INCREASES BY NATIONAL WESTMINSTER BANK P. L. C. AND MIDLAND BANK P. L. C. GO INTO EFFECT TODAY
01lc020w BASE RATES ARE THE BENCHMARK FOR COMMERCIAL LENDING IN BRITAIN
01lc020x MORE IMPORTANT THAN ARITHMETIC HOWEVER IS MR. JACKSON'S MESSAGE
01lc020y SPEAKING TO BLACK ASPIRATIONS HE REPRESENTS THE BEST OF THE AMERICAN DREAM
01lc020z HE MIGHT EVEN QUALIFY AS A SOCIAL CONSERVATIVE IF NOT FOR HIS ENDORSEMENT OF HOMOSEXUAL RIGHTS
01lc0210 SO FAR THE ADMINISTRATION HAS IGNORED THESE APPEALS AND SO HAVE MR. REED AND OTHER BANKERS
01lc0211 IT SEEMS THAT THE PRINCIPLES ENUNCIATED AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS DEBATE BY MESSRS.
01lc0212 WRISTON AND THEOBALD STILL PREVAIL IF NOT IN LENDING THE BANK'S MONEY AT LEAST IN SUGGESTING THAT OTHER INVESTORS PUT UP THE CASH
01lc0213 THE AVERAGE DAILY TRADING VOLUME IN R. J. R. NABISCO OPTIONS IN SEPTEMBER WAS ABOUT ONE THOUSAND CONTRACTS MR. MOULDS SAID
01lc0214 LAST TUESDAY MORE THAN FOUR THOUSAND OPTIONS TRADED ON WEDNESDAY THE DAY PRECEDING THE ANNOUNCEMENT SEVEN THOUSAND FIFTY CONTRACTS TRADED
01lc0215 AFTER THE BUY OUT PROPOSAL WAS MADE PUBLIC THURSDAY TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED FIFTY R. J. R. NABISCO OPTIONS TRADED ON THE C. B. O. E.
01lc0216 I WAS ENVIOUS OF MY TEAM'S SNATCHER A TALL SKINNY NURSE UNTIL I SAW WHAT SHE HAD TO ENDURE IN THE NAME OF ESPRIT DE CORPS
01lc0217 HER LONG LEGS WERE STRETCHED WIDE AND BOUND WITH RIBBONS TO THE HORNS OF THE DRAGON'S HEAD
01lc0218 HER TORSO WAS TAUT WITH TENSION LEANING OUT BEYOND THE BUMPY DRAGON'S HEAD UPON WHICH SHE RESTED HER STOMACH
01lc0219 THERE ARE STILL LEGISLATIVE ISSUES TO BE RESOLVED ON THE SENATE FLOOR AND AMONG FOUR HOUSE COMMITTEES BEFORE THE BILL REACHES THE HOUSE FLOOR
01lc021a BUSINESS GROUPS FOR EXAMPLE ARE UNHAPPY AT PROVISIONS REQUIRING BUS COMPANIES TO INSTALL WHEELCHAIR LIFTS AND HANDICAPPED TOILETS IN NEW OVER THE ROAD BUSES
01lc021b THE GROUPS ALSO CRITICIZE THE LACK OF A BLANKET SMALL BUSINESS EXEMPTION FOR PUBLIC ACCOMMODATIONS
01lc021c BUT MANY OTHER BUSINESS OBJECTIONS HAVE ALREADY BEEN DEALT WITH IN THE WHITE HOUSE SENATE NEGOTIATIONS PRETTY MUCH ELIMINATING THE CHANCES THAT THE MEASURE COULD YET BE DERAILED
01lc021d TO THE EXTENT THAT EXPORT GROWTH CONTINUES IT WILL KEEP THE U. S. ECONOMY FROM SLIPPING ADDED MR. WITTEN
01lc021e SO YOU CAN HAVE A SOFT LANDING SCENARIO BASED ON EXPANDING EXPORTS
01lc021f A SOFT LANDING COMBINES MODERATE ECONOMIC GROWTH WITH LOW INFLATION

01mc0203 THESE STOCKS HAVE GONE UP TO SUCH AN EXTENT THAT THE PRICE EARNINGS MULTIPLE IS MUCH HIGHER ABROAD THAN HERE
01mc0204 THAT WOULD MAKE THE NON DOLLAR EQUITY INVESTMENT LESS ATTRACTIVE
01mc0206 IT LARGELY REFLECTS BIG AGGRESSIVE EXPORTERS THAT HAVE RESEARCHED AMERICAN MARKETS DESIGNED THEIR OWN PRODUCTS SPENT HEAVILY TO DEVELOP BRAND NAMES AND CONTROLLED THEIR OWN MARKETING
01mc0207 THEY VIEW AMERICAN COMPANIES MOSTLY AS COMPETITORS

01mc020r DRAMS DYNAMIC RANDOM ACCESS MEMORIES ARE A PARTICULAR EXAMPLE
01mc020s OUR SYSTEMS GROUP USES THEM ALONG WITH OUR OWN MICROPROCESSORS TO BUILD MICROCOMPUTER SYSTEMS
01mc020t EVEN THOUGH INTEL WAS THE FIRST MANUFACTURER OF SUCH DEVICES WE ALONG WITH MOST OTHER U. S. MANUFACTURERS STOPPED MAKING THEM YEARS AGO

01mc0213 OF THE THREE HUNDRED FIFTY WHO RECEIVED THE PLACEBO FIVE POINT SEVEN PERCENT DIED
01mc0214 THEN THERE ARE DIFFERENCES IN HOW CORPORATE DIRECTORS ARE REQUIRED TO ACT
01mc0215 IN BRITAIN DIRECTORS' LEGAL DUTY IS TO SHAREHOLDERS DUTCH LAW OBLIGATES DIRECTORS TO PROTECT THE COMPANY'S INTEREST INCLUDING EMPLOYEES CUSTOMERS AND CREDITORS
01mc0216 DUTCH LAW IS SO HOSTILE TO UNFRIENDLY BIDS THAT NONE HAS SUCCEEDED THERE SINCE NINETEEN SIXTY
01mc0217 SO SO
01mc0218 THAT MAKES THE PROBLEM A LITTLE HARDER
01mc0219 LET ME THINK FOR A MINUTE
01mc021a WHEN THE HOUSE AND SENATE APPROVED THE TAX BILL EARLY SATURDAY LAWMAKERS DIDN'T MENTION THE LAST MINUTE PROVISIONS AND CONGRESSIONAL STAFFERS DESCRIBED THEM AS TECHNICAL
01mc021b WHILE THE ESTIMATED REVENUE OF ALMOST ONE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS OVER THREE YEARS IS RELATIVELY SMALL <NOISE> THE PROVISIONS MIGHT BE PERCEIVED AS AN ANTI TAKEOVER PUSH BY CONGRESS
