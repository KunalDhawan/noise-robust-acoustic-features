027c0201 U. S. BANKS IN JAPAN CURRENTLY CAN TRADE IN SOME SECURITIES BUT ARE BASICALLY CONFINED TO DEALING WITH THE ONE HUNDRED TWENTY LARGEST JAPANESE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS
027c0202 THEY CAN'T DEAL WITH EITHER RETAIL CUSTOMERS OR CORPORATIONS
027c0203 THEY CAN UNDERWRITE JAPANESE GOVERNMENT BONDS BUT THE SHARE OF SUCH BUSINESS REMAINS VERY SMALL
027c0204 IT ALSO INCREASES THE LIKELIHOOD OF DEFECTIONS FROM HILL SAMUEL'S ONE HUNDRED THIRTY MEMBER CORPORATE FINANCE GROUP ACCORDING TO INSIDERS AND OFFICIALS OF OTHER BANKS
027c0205 AS PART OF T. S. B. THE DEPARTMENT MAINLY WOULD SERVE SMALL COMPANIES IN THE UNITED KINGDOM
027c0206 MANY MEMBERS OF THE TEAM HAD SOUGHT AN ALLIANCE WITH A LARGER GLOBAL PARTNER
027c0207 UNTIL THE LAST MINUTE THEY HAD THOUGHT THE OPERATION WOULD BE SOLD TO BARCLAYS BANK P. L. C.
027c0208 EVEN BEFORE BLACK MONDAY RETAILERS WERE NERVOUS ABOUT THIS CHRISTMAS SEASON
027c0209 STORE SALES HAD BEEN SOFT FOR SEVERAL MONTHS AMID SIGNS THAT THE CONSUMER LED ECONOMIC EXPANSION WAS FALTERING
027c020a THE DOLLAR'S DECLINE HADN'T HELPED EITHER AS RETAILERS WHO DEPEND ON GOODS FROM THE FAR EAST HAD TO ABSORB HIGHER COSTS
027c020b CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN INHERITED FROM HIS PREDECESSOR PAUL VOLCKER A MONETARY POLICY THAT HAD BEEN QUITE ERRATIC
027c020c THE FED ALLOWED THE MONEY SUPPLY TO GROW VERY RAPIDLY THROUGH NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX
027c020d THEN IN EARLY NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN THE CENTRAL BANK TIGHTENED UP SHARPLY
027c020e FOR THE FIRST FEW MONTHS OF THIS YEAR I THOUGHT POLICY MIGHT BE ALL RIGHT SAYS MILTON FRIEDMAN OF THE HOOVER INSTITUTION
027c020f YOU COULD SAY THAT IT WAS OFFSETTING THE EXCESSIVELY EASY POLICY OF NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX
027c020g BUT THE RESTRAINT CONTINUED AND IN EARLY OCTOBER BEFORE THE MARKET CRASH MR. FRIEDMAN PREDICTED A RECESSION WOULD START IN SIX TO NINE MONTHS
027c020h LAST MARCH DISASTER STRUCK
027c020i THE PLANTS WILTED AND DIED
027c020j THE CALGARY COMPLEX WAS ON THE SITE OF A DISMANTLED OIL REFINERY AND MR. SPRUNG SAYS CONTAMINANTS FROM THE GROUND KILLED THE PLANTS
027c020k THE PLACE ALMOST BLEW UP WITH THE GASOLINE COMING IN FROM OUTSIDE HE SAYS

027c020m I'M A LITTLE SCARED
027c020n I DON'T BLAME PEOPLE FOR NOT BEING HEROES
027c020o BOTH STAPLES AND OFFICE CLUB HOPE TO BE ABLE TO GO PUBLIC NEXT YEAR
027c020p THEY AREN'T AFRAID OF LARGE DISCOUNTERS SUCH AS K. MART AND AMES
027c020q MR. PEARLMAN THE PORTFOLIO MANAGER SAYS HISTORY HASN'T SHOWN THAT BIG RETAILERS HAVE BEEN GOOD AT SPECIALTY RETAILING
027c020r OTHER LARGE AND MIDSIZED CARS POSTING GOOD SCORES WERE THE MERCURY SABLE THE OLDSMOBILE DELTA EIGHTY EIGHT AND THE BUICK REGAL
027c020s THREE CARS IN THE CATEGORY PERFORMED POORLY POSTING SCORES ABOVE ONE THOUSAND FOR THE DRIVER'S SIDE
027c020t THEY WERE THE BUICK PARK AVENUE THE CHRYSLER NEW YORKER AND THE RENAULT MEDALLION
027c020u ALL THE CARS TESTED WERE FOUR DOOR VEHICLES EXCEPT THE BUICK
027c020v ESTIMATES OF THE MAKEUP OF THE FEEDLOT POPULATION VARY WIDELY
027c020w MOST ANALYSTS EXPECT THE GOVERNMENT TO REPORT THAT THE NUMBER OF YOUNG CATTLE PLACED ON FEEDLOTS FELL IN JULY FOR THE SECOND CONSECUTIVE MONTH FROM A YEAR EARLIER
027c020x HOWEVER SOME EXPECT A RISE
027c020y NOT ALL BLACK COLLEGES ARE ON THE ROPES
027c020z IN FACT A NUMBER OF ELITE INSTITUTIONS ARE THRIVING IN PART BECAUSE OF THEIR HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL FUND RAISING EFFORTS
027c0210 LAST WEEK FOR INSTANCE MR. COSBY AND HIS WIFE CAMILLE DONATED TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS TO SPELMAN COLLEGE A BLACK WOMEN'S COLLEGE IN ATLANTA
027c0211 THAT LEAVES THE OPTION OF A MILITARY STRIKE AT TERRORISTS OR THEIR BASES WHICH ARE MAINLY IN LEBANON'S BEKAA VALLEY AN AREA UNDER SYRIAN CONTROL
027c0212 U. S. INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES HAVE IDENTIFIED AS POTENTIAL TARGETS THERE BUILDINGS KNOWN TO HAVE BEEN USED BY HEZBOLLAH FORCES AND THEIR MENTORS THE IRANIAN REVOLUTIONARY GUARDS
027c0213 BUT THEY AREN'T CERTAIN WHICH FACTIONS USE WHICH BUILDINGS OR WHEN THEY ARE PRESENT
027c0214 NATIONAL ADVERTISERS HAILING FROM AS FAR EAST AS NEW YORK ARE INDEED STARTING TO DISCOVER THE OTHER COAST OR AT LEAST A FEW SELECT AGENCIES HERE
027c0215 CREATIVE HOT SHOPS LIKE LOS ANGELES'S CHIAT SLASH DAY AND SAN FRANCISCO'S HAL RINEY AND PARTNERS CAUGHT THE OUTSIDERS' EYES FIRST
027c0216 BUT LATELY WESTERN OUTPOSTS OF A FEW OLD LINE AGENCIES LIKE CHICAGO BASED FOOTE CONE ARE STARTING TO BECOME NATIONAL ADVERTISING POWERS IN THEIR OWN RIGHT
027c0217 I WAS ENVIOUS OF MY TEAM'S SNATCHER A TALL SKINNY NURSE UNTIL I SAW WHAT SHE HAD TO ENDURE IN THE NAME OF ESPRIT DE CORPS
027c0218 HER LONG LEGS WERE STRETCHED WIDE AND BOUND WITH RIBBONS TO THE HORNS OF THE DRAGON'S HEAD
027c0219 HER TORSO WAS TAUT WITH TENSION LEANING OUT BEYOND THE DUMPY DRAGON'S HEAD UPON WHICH SHE RESTED HER STOMACH
027c021a MR. BROOKS'S ARTICLE AWAKENED MEMORIES OF MY TIME AS MR. HOOK'S STUDENT AT NEW YORK UNIVERSITY'S WASHINGTON SQUARE COLLEGE SOME TWENTY EIGHT YEARS AGO
027c021b ONE OF MR. HOOK'S MOST REMARKABLE PARABLES STILL STAYS FRESH IN MY MIND
