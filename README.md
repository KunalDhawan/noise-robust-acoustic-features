# Noise Robust Acoustic Features

This repository contains the complete code for my internship project 'An i-vector based Non-Negative Matrix Factorization approach towards noise robust Automatic Speech Recognition' at the Signal Analysis and Interpretation Laboratory (SAIL), University of Southern California (USC).
Please follow the file code_documentation to get an idea of the directory structure and how to use the code.
Project documentation is available at my webpage- https://bit.ly/30cM4Jk
The following paper explains in depth the proposed approach and it's efficacy- https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.06859.pdf
