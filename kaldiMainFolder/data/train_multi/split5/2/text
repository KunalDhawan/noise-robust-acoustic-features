01lc020v SIMILAR INCREASES BY NATIONAL WESTMINSTER BANK P. L. C. AND MIDLAND BANK P. L. C. GO INTO EFFECT TODAY
01lc020w BASE RATES ARE THE BENCHMARK FOR COMMERCIAL LENDING IN BRITAIN
01lc020x MORE IMPORTANT THAN ARITHMETIC HOWEVER IS MR. JACKSON'S MESSAGE
01lc020y SPEAKING TO BLACK ASPIRATIONS HE REPRESENTS THE BEST OF THE AMERICAN DREAM
01lc020z HE MIGHT EVEN QUALIFY AS A SOCIAL CONSERVATIVE IF NOT FOR HIS ENDORSEMENT OF HOMOSEXUAL RIGHTS
01lc0210 SO FAR THE ADMINISTRATION HAS IGNORED THESE APPEALS AND SO HAVE MR. REED AND OTHER BANKERS
01lc0211 IT SEEMS THAT THE PRINCIPLES ENUNCIATED AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS DEBATE BY MESSRS.
01lc0212 WRISTON AND THEOBALD STILL PREVAIL IF NOT IN LENDING THE BANK'S MONEY AT LEAST IN SUGGESTING THAT OTHER INVESTORS PUT UP THE CASH

01lc0218 HER TORSO WAS TAUT WITH TENSION LEANING OUT BEYOND THE BUMPY DRAGON'S HEAD UPON WHICH SHE RESTED HER STOMACH
01lc0219 THERE ARE STILL LEGISLATIVE ISSUES TO BE RESOLVED ON THE SENATE FLOOR AND AMONG FOUR HOUSE COMMITTEES BEFORE THE BILL REACHES THE HOUSE FLOOR
01lc021a BUSINESS GROUPS FOR EXAMPLE ARE UNHAPPY AT PROVISIONS REQUIRING BUS COMPANIES TO INSTALL WHEELCHAIR LIFTS AND HANDICAPPED TOILETS IN NEW OVER THE ROAD BUSES
01lc021b THE GROUPS ALSO CRITICIZE THE LACK OF A BLANKET SMALL BUSINESS EXEMPTION FOR PUBLIC ACCOMMODATIONS
01lc021c BUT MANY OTHER BUSINESS OBJECTIONS HAVE ALREADY BEEN DEALT WITH IN THE WHITE HOUSE SENATE NEGOTIATIONS PRETTY MUCH ELIMINATING THE CHANCES THAT THE MEASURE COULD YET BE DERAILED
