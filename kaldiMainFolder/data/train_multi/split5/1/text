01ic020q AGE DISCRIMINATION IS OFTEN THE BASIS FOR LEGAL ACTION BY AN EMPLOYEE AGAINST HIS FORMER COMPANY
01ic020r WHEN A MAJOR NATIONAL RETAILER WENT THROUGH A COST CUTTING PERIOD A NUMBER OF OLDER EXECUTIVES WERE DISCHARGED AT THE SAME TIME AS THE CONSOLIDATION OF DEPARTMENTS
01ic020s THESE EXECUTIVES BANDED TOGETHER AND INSTITUTED A CLASS ACTION SUIT AGAINST THE FORMER EMPLOYER
01ic020t A VERY SIMILAR CASE OCCURRED WITH ANOTHER NATIONAL RETAILER THAT SOUGHT TO REDUCE ITS OVERHEAD AND OPERATING EXPENSES

01ic021a SCHLOSS ITSELF WAS FINED AND CENSURED BY THE S. E. C.
01ic021b BUT MR. AINSBERG MAY HAVE FARED JUST AS BADLY
