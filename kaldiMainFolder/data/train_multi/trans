 WHILE HE BELIEVES THE DOLLAR WILL MOVE LOWER AGAINST THE MAJOR CURRENCIES THE SOFTENING EXPORT MARKET IS PRESSURING JAPANESE AND EUROPEAN EXPORTERS
 THESE STOCKS HAVE GONE UP TO SUCH AN EXTENT THAT THE PRICE EARNINGS MULTIPLE IS MUCH HIGHER ABROAD THAN HERE
 THAT WOULD MAKE THE NON DOLLAR EQUITY INVESTMENT LESS ATTRACTIVE
 IT LARGELY REFLECTS BIG AGGRESSIVE EXPORTERS THAT HAVE RESEARCHED AMERICAN MARKETS DESIGNED THEIR OWN PRODUCTS SPENT HEAVILY TO DEVELOP BRAND NAMES AND CONTROLLED THEIR OWN MARKETING
 THEY VIEW AMERICAN COMPANIES MOSTLY AS COMPETITORS
 COLONEL OCHOA THE U. S. CHANGES ITS POLICY EVERY FOUR YEARS
 IT IS NOT A CONSISTENT POLICY LIKE THAT OF THE SOVIET UNION WHICH HAS A SINGLE LINE FOR A PROLONGED PERIOD
 WITH THE AMERICANS WE DON'T KNOW WHERE WE STAND
 TODAY THEY ARE OUR ALLIES TOMORROW THEY CAN ABANDON US TO OUR FATE
 THE PRESENT GOVERNMENT HARDLY ACTS AT ALL IT ONLY REACTS TO WHAT WASHINGTON SAYS AND THAT IS THE PROBLEM
 IF THE BUY OUT SUCCEEDS *GRANTREE'S* MANAGEMENT IS TO HOLD AN UNDISCLOSED STAKE IN THE COMPANY
 THE COMPANY'S BOARD HAS RECOMMENDED THAT THE SHAREHOLDERS ACCEPT THE BID
 IF THE TAKEOVER EFFORT DOESN'T GO THROUGH *GRANTREE* WILL UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES BE OBLIGED TO PAY THE INVESTOR GROUP ONE POINT THREE MILLION DOLLARS IN BREAK FEES AND EXPENSES
 THE CHANGING PERCEPTION OF THE TWO IS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT IN IOWA THE TRADITIONAL OPENING ROUND IN THE HEAVYWEIGHT PRESIDENTIAL CHAMPIONSHIP
 IOWA VOTERS CAUCUS TO PICK DELEGATES ON FEBRUARY EIGHTH
 A RECENT N. B. C. POLL SHOWS SEVENTY SEVEN PERCENT OF IOWA REPUBLICANS SUPPORT THE TREATY AND ONLY TWELVE PERCENT OPPOSE IT
 THE SAME POLL SHOWS SENATOR DOLE RUNNING SIXTEEN POINTS AHEAD OF THE VICE PRESIDENT AMONG REPUBLICANS LIKELY TO ATTEND THE CAUCUSES
 WE SAW WITH OIL AND WE'RE SEEING IT WITH GOLD SAYS JOHN DESSAUER AN ORLEANS MASSACHUSETTS MONEY MANAGER

 THE STRANGEST INQUIRY LOBBED AT BILL WAS WHAT ROLE I SAW AT FORD FOR MY DAUGHTERS WHO ARE TWO YEARS OLD AND TWO MONTHS OLD

 DRAMS DYNAMIC RANDOM ACCESS MEMORIES ARE A PARTICULAR EXAMPLE
 OUR SYSTEMS GROUP USES THEM ALONG WITH OUR OWN MICROPROCESSORS TO BUILD MICROCOMPUTER SYSTEMS
 EVEN THOUGH INTEL WAS THE FIRST MANUFACTURER OF SUCH DEVICES WE ALONG WITH MOST OTHER U. S. MANUFACTURERS STOPPED MAKING THEM YEARS AGO
 TODAY A U. S. DRAM IS PRACTICALLY AN EXTINCT SPECIES
 IRAQ SAID ITS WARPLANES ATTACKED A PANAMANIAN FLAG FREIGHTER SETTING IT ABLAZE AND ADRIFT IN THE NORTHERN PERSIAN GULF

 T. P. A. REDUCED THE NUMBER OF PATIENT DEATHS BY FIFTY ONE PERCENT IN THE FIRST TWO WEEKS AFTER HEART ATTACK
 OF THE THREE HUNDRED FIFTY PATIENTS WHO WERE GIVEN T. P. A. TWO POINT EIGHT PERCENT DIED IN THAT PERIOD
 OF THE THREE HUNDRED FIFTY WHO RECEIVED THE PLACEBO FIVE POINT SEVEN PERCENT DIED
 THEN THERE ARE DIFFERENCES IN HOW CORPORATE DIRECTORS ARE REQUIRED TO ACT
 IN BRITAIN DIRECTORS' LEGAL DUTY IS TO SHAREHOLDERS DUTCH LAW OBLIGATES DIRECTORS TO PROTECT THE COMPANY'S INTEREST INCLUDING EMPLOYEES CUSTOMERS AND CREDITORS
 DUTCH LAW IS SO HOSTILE TO UNFRIENDLY BIDS THAT NONE HAS SUCCEEDED THERE SINCE NINETEEN SIXTY
 SO SO
 THAT MAKES THE PROBLEM A LITTLE HARDER
 LET ME THINK FOR A MINUTE

 WHILE THE ESTIMATED REVENUE OF ALMOST ONE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS OVER THREE YEARS IS RELATIVELY SMALL <NOISE> THE PROVISIONS MIGHT BE PERCEIVED AS AN ANTI TAKEOVER PUSH BY CONGRESS

 THE SENATE PLAN WOULD PROVIDE THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE NATIONAL GUARD TO HELP THE CUSTOMS SERVICE WITH DRUG INSPECTIONS AT THE U. S. BORDER

 LOST WAGES SOME ECONOMISTS ARE DISMAYED AT THE LABOR DEPARTMENT'S PLANS TO DROP THE HOURLY EARNINGS INDEX FROM ITS MONTHLY EMPLOYMENT REPORT NEXT YEAR
 IT'S A FASHIONABLE NUMBER SAID MR. CHANDROSS OF LLOYD'S BANK NEW YORK
 ECONOMISTS ARE CURRENTLY FOCUSING ON THE INDEX TO GET A READING ON WAGE INFLATION
 THE LABOR DEPARTMENT WILL CONTINUE TO REPORT MONTHLY AGGREGATE DATA ON AVERAGE HOURLY EARNINGS
 BUT THE INDEX IS BEING REPLACED BY THE EMPLOYMENT COST SERIES
 ECONOMISTS SAID THE NEW INDEX HAS THE ADVANTAGE OF BEING A MORE RELIABLE READING AND THE DISADVANTAGE OF COMING OUT ONLY ONCE A QUARTER RATHER THAN EVERY MONTH
 HIGHER COMMISSIONS CAN ALSO REDUCE THE INVESTMENT VALUE OF LIFE INSURANCE POLICIES THAT INCLUDE A SAVINGS COMPONENT SUCH AS UNIVERSAL LIFE POLICIES

 ALL INDICATIONS SUGGEST THOUGH THAT THE REAGAN NAKASONE SUMMIT WILL NOT BE ABOUT MONETARY POLICIES
 THEY WILL DISCUSS TRADE ISSUES WHICH ARE CERTAINLY IMPORTANT BUT RATHER REMOTE FROM THE IMMEDIATE PROBLEM
 ALL OF THE WORLD'S EXPORTS AND IMPORTS COME TO ABOUT TWO TRILLION DOLLARS A YEAR
 BUT FOREIGN EXCHANGE MARKET TRADING AMOUNTS TO ABOUT ONE TRILLION DOLLARS A WEEK
 IT IS THE FINANCIAL MARKETS THAT THE BATTLE OF THE DOLLAR WILL HAVE TO BE FOUGHT
 INVESTORS RANGING FROM U. S. CORPORATIONS TO JAPANESE BUYERS OF U. S. TREASURY BILLS MUST FACTOR IN A RISK PREMIUM FOR DOLLAR VALIDITY
 THUS IT IS AT LEAST PLAUSIBLE IF NOT LIKELY THAT DOLLAR VALIDITY IS ONE REASON REAL INTEREST RATES HAVE STAYED HIGH IN THE U. S.
 IT IS CERTAINLY TRUE THAT NO PLAN TO RESTORE STABILITY TO WORLD MARKETS CAN SUCCEED WITHOUT ADDRESSING DOLLAR VALIDITY
 THERE IS A GROWING MIDDLE CLASS OF COLOMBIANS WHO HAVE WORKED THEIR WAY UP AND ARE NOW BUYING THEIR OWN HOMES AND IMPROVING THEIR STANDARDS OF LIVING
 THEY ARE AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE STABILITY OF THE ECONOMY ABHOR VIOLENCE AND ARE USUALLY PRO U. S.
 FURTHER THE HOSPITALITY AND KINDNESS OF THE COLOMBIAN PEOPLE ARE SUPERB
 I FOUND THIS TO BE TRUE NOT JUST IN THE MAJOR CITIES BUT ALSO IN AREAS THAT THE STATE DEPARTMENT CONSIDERED RISKY
 THERE IS NO SHORTAGE OF EXAMPLES
 GROWING LIFE EXPECTANCY THREATENS TO BANKRUPT SOCIAL SECURITY BUT THE COMPROMISE OF NINETEEN EIGHTY THREE DID LITTLE MORE THAN BURDEN WORKERS BY RAISING THE PAYROLL TAX
 THE GOVERNMENT CONTINUES TO PILE UP GREAT DEFICITS BUT THE BUDGET SUMMIT COMPROMISE OF LAST AUTUMN HARDLY CUTS ANYTHING AT ALL
 SOVIET INFLUENCE IN NICARAGUA THREATENS U. S. SECURITY BUT THE U. S. HOUSE ENGAGES IN A PITCHED BATTLE OVER EVEN SCRAPS OF MILITARY HARDWARE TO THE CONTRAS
 I THINK THE MARKET JUMPED THE GUN ON THE NOTION OF A WEAK ECONOMY AND THE FED EASING MR. FINE SAID
 SO WHAT WE'RE SEEING NOW IS A CONSOLIDATION
 HE EXPECTS LONG TERM TREASURY BOND YIELDS TO HOVER AROUND THE EIGHT AND ONE HALF PERCENT LEVEL IN THE NEAR FUTURE
 THE STANDOFF CASTS DOUBTS ABOUT HOW SINCERE JAPANESE COMPANIES ARE IN THEIR STATED WILLINGNESS TO BUY MORE U. S. MADE CHIPS
 IT ALSO COULD STYMIE A NEW NEGOTIATING APPROACH IN WHICH THE INDUSTRIES NOT THE GOVERNMENTS IRON OUT TRADE DISPUTES
 THAT COULD DRIVE AMERICAN CHIP MAKERS TO ASK THE U. S. GOVERNMENT FOR MORE PUNITIVE MEASURES AGAINST JAPAN
 DURING ANY REPAIR PROCESS BLOOD CLOTS ARE CONSTANTLY BEING FORMED AND DISSOLVED
 IT IS QUITE POSSIBLE SCIENTISTS SPECULATE THAT DURING ATTEMPTS TO REPAIR THE ARTERY WALL THE BODY AT SOME POINT TRIES TO DISSOLVE A BLOOD CLOT
 BUT IT MISTAKENLY GRABS PROTEIN INSTEAD OF PLASMINOGEN PULLING IT WITH ITS BAG OF FAT AND CHOLESTEROL INTO THE ARTERY WALL
 THIS THWARTS THE REPAIR PROCESS AND BEGINS A VICIOUS CYCLE DRAWING MORE AND MORE CHOLESTEROL INTO THE DAMAGED AREA
 AND IN FACT MICROSCOPIC BLOOD CLOTS AND BITS OF LP ARE FOUND IN THE MISHMASH OF THE DEPOSITS
 IF THE SETTLEMENT IS COMPLETED THE COMPANY WOULD JOIN SHAREHOLDER PLAINTIFFS IN SEEKING DAMAGES AGAINST FOUNDER EDDIE ANTAR AND OTHERS
 CRAZY EDDIE CURRENTLY IS A DEFENDANT IN THE HOLDERS' LITIGATION

 SCIENTISTS IN GENERAL MUST COME TO TERMS WITH THEIR RELIANCE ON CONGRESS FOR FINANCIAL SUPPORT
 SPACE SCIENTISTS NOW COMPETE FOR ATTENTION WITH OTHER BIG SCIENCE PROJECTS SUCH AS MAPPING THE HUMAN GENOME OR THE SUPER COLLIDER

 IT IS IN THE FINANCIAL MARKETS THAT THE BATTLE OF THE DOLLAR WILL HAVE TO BE FOUGHT
 INVESTORS RANGING FROM U. S. CORPORATIONS TO JAPANESE BUYERS OF U. S. T. BILLS MUST FACTOR IN A RISK PREMIUM FOR DOLLAR VOLATILITY
 THUS IT IS AT LEAST PLAUSIBLE IF NOT LIKELY THAT DOLLAR VOLATILITY IS ONE REASON REAL INTEREST RATES HAVE STAYED HIGH IN THE U. S.
 IT IS CERTAINLY TRUE THAT NO PLAN TO RESTORE STABILITY TO WORLD MARKETS CAN SUCCEED WITHOUT ADDRESSING DOLLAR VOLATILITY
 THERE IS NO SHORTAGE OF EXAMPLES

 THE PRESIDENT'S ACTION WAS THE CULMINATION OF THAT PROCESS AND IT HAD NOTHING WHATSOEVER TO DO WITH TRADE BILLS
 PRESIDENT REAGAN BELIEVES THAT PEOPLE AND NATIONS SHOULD HONOR THEIR OBLIGATIONS
 THERE IS NOTHING PROTECTIONIST ABOUT THAT

 MR. BERG CONTENDS THAT INVESTORS SHOULD BE DIVING INTO STOCKS PICKING UP EASY PROFITS IN THE NEXT FIVE MONTHS

 ANALYSTS SAID THE PROXY FIGHT DEFEAT DEALS A BODY BLOW TO BANK OF NEW YORK'S BID
 JAMES J. MCDERMOTT JUNIOR DIRECTOR OF RESEARCH FOR KEEFE BRUYETTE AND WOODS INCORPORATED SAID THIS EFFECTIVELY PUTS THE DEAL OUT TO PASTURE

 DESPITE YESTERDAY'S DROP ACCORDING TO JUDY GANES AN ANALYST FOR SHEARSON LEHMAN HUTTON NEW YORK BULLISH FUNDAMENTALS FOR SUGAR REMAIN UNCHANGED
 DEMAND FOR SUGAR IS INCREASING BOTH DOMESTICALLY AND WORLD WIDE MS. GANES SAID
 SUGAR STOCKS IN EXPORTING COUNTRIES HAVE DROPPED TO A POINT THAT UNEXPECTED INCREASES IN DEMAND MAY NOT BE MET
 ESTIMATES OF THE MAKEUP OF THE FEEDLOT POPULATION VARY WIDELY
 MOST ANALYSTS EXPECT THE GOVERNMENT TO REPORT THAT THE NUMBER OF YOUNG CATTLE PLACED ON FEEDLOTS FELL IN JULY FOR THE SECOND CONSECUTIVE MONTH FROM A YEAR EARLIER
 HOWEVER SOME EXPECT A RISE
 THE BILL WHICH IS EXPECTED TO BE ENACTED IN THE NEXT FEW DAYS ALSO WOULD PREVENT STATES FROM SETTING OTHER CREDIT CARD DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS

 WHAT TRIGGERED G. M.'S NEW STRATEGY ISN'T CLEAR
 WHILE G. M. APPARENTLY HAS DECIDED THAT ITS INCREASINGLY GENEROUS INCENTIVE PROGRAMS HAD GOTTEN PROHIBITIVELY EXPENSIVE CUTTING PRODUCTION IS COSTLY TOO
 THE HIGH FIXED COSTS OF IDLE FACILITIES SURELY WILL DEPRESS G. M.'S FIRST QUARTER PROFIT
 EVEN WHEN COMPLAINTS ARE FILED THEY CAN BE DIFFICULT TO VERIFY
 AGENCIES GENERALLY DON'T USE UNDERCOVER TESTERS POSING AS PROSPECTIVE TENANTS AS THEY DO IN RACE DISCRIMINATION COMPLAINTS THEY FEAR THAT THE TESTER COULD BE ATTACKED
 INSTEAD THEY TRY TO BUILD CASES ON THE TESTIMONY OF CURRENT AND FORMER TENANTS
 THE REMAINING OFFSETTING COLLECTIONS OF MORE THAN THREE BILLION DOLLARS COME FROM USER FEES WHICH ALSO CLEARLY ARE NOT TAXES
 A USER FEE IS A SPECIFIC CHARGE FOR A DIRECT BENEFIT RECEIVED
 LIKE AN ASSET SALE BUT UNLIKE A TAX A USER FEE DOES NOT INVOLVE COMPULSION
 ONE CHARACTERISTIC OF USER FEES IS THAT THEY REVEAL HOW MUCH GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS ARE REALLY WORTH TO DIRECT RECIPIENTS IN THE MOST DIRECT AND MEANINGFUL WAY POSSIBLE
 ONE OF THE STRONGEST ARGUMENTS THAT A GOVERNMENT PROGRAM IS WORTHWHILE OCCURS WHEN IT HAS A USER FEE AND THE FEE COVERS COSTS
 THE REVERSE IS ALSO TRUE AND THAT IS ONE REASON SOME BENEFICIARIES OPPOSE USER FEES

 BUT JOHN SMALE P. AND G'S CHAIRMAN AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE USED THE MEETING TO SPEAK AT LENGTH ABOUT HOSTILE TAKEOVERS IN GENERAL
 HE MAINTAINED THAT TOO OFTEN THEY LEAVE COMPANIES LOADED WITH DEBT AND SHRUNKEN RESEARCH BUDGETS AND IGNORE THE INTERESTS OF EMPLOYEES AND THE COMMUNITIES IN WHICH THE COMPANIES DO BUSINESS
 HE ALSO ARGUED THAT OVER THE LONG RUN HOSTILE TAKEOVERS DON'T NECESSARILY PROVIDE A GOOD MECHANISM FOR SHAREHOLDERS TO REALIZE FULL VALUE FOR THEIR SHARES
 MOODY'S SAID BRAZIL HAD DETERIORATED DRASTICALLY POLITICALLY AND ECONOMICALLY OVER THE PAST TWELVE MONTHS

 WHEN THE CHINESE PRESS IN TIBET RESPONDED BY SAVAGELY ATTACKING BOTH THE PRO INDEPENDENCE MOVEMENT AND THE DALAI LAMA HIMSELF THE MONKS WERE MOVED TO ACTION

 I SENT IN SIX CARDS MYSELF THE PILOT SAID INCLUDING SOME INVOLVING INSUFFICIENT TAKEOFF POWER BECAUSE OF MECHANICAL PROBLEMS
 BUT TO IDENTIFY THE PLANE BY NUMBER OR FLIGHT TIME HE ADDED WOULD BE AN ADMISSION OF OUR OWN CULPABILITY IN THE PROBLEM
 ANOTHER EASTERN PILOT SAID THAT DESPITE MR. BURNLEY'S CRITICISM HE CONSIDERED THE CAMPAIGN A SUCCESS
 INOPERATIVE ITEMS THAT ONCE PERSISTED FOR WEEKS ARE BEING REPAIRED MORE CONSISTENTLY HE SAID
 THE SENATE PLAN WOULD PROVIDE THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE NATIONAL GUARD TO HELP THE CUSTOMS SERVICE WITH DRUG INSPECTIONS AT U. S. BORDERS
 BUT ADDITIONAL USE OF MILITARY RADAR PLANES EXPANDED NAVAL PATROLS AND MORE FREQUENT AIRCRAFT INTERCEPTIONS COULD DRAIN THE MILITARY'S ALREADY TIGHT OPERATING BUDGETS
 THE MEASURE DOESN'T PROVIDE ANY SPECIAL FUNDS FOR THESE OPERATIONS

 BOND TRADERS ALSO WERE CHEERED BY ANOTHER DROP IN OIL FUTURES PRICES THE SEVENTH DECLINE IN THE PAST EIGHT SESSIONS
 THE DROP HAS INDICATED TO SOME ANALYSTS THAT INFLATION FEARS WERE GREATLY EXAGGERATED
 PREVIOUSLY OIL PRICES HAD SURGED ABOVE TWENTY TWO DOLLARS A BARREL LARGELY ON FEAR THAT GROWING TENSION IN THE PERSIAN GULF MIGHT LEAD TO A DISRUPTION OF OIL SUPPLIES
 IF THE PROPOSED TRANSACTION IS COMPLETED COCA COLA WILL BE LEFT WITH HUGE BORROWING CAPACITY
 COCA COLA SAID ITS PRO FORMA DEBT WOULD BE REDUCED TO ABOUT NINE PERCENT OF TOTAL CAPITAL
 THE COMPANY'S DEBT WAS TWENTY SIX PERCENT OF CAPITAL AT THE END OF THE SECOND QUARTER ITS TARGET RATIO IS THIRTY FIVE PERCENT
 HOWEVER THE LONG SIEGE OF CORPORATE COST CUTTING HAS ALREADY SLASHED CORPORATE PAYROLLS SO SEVERELY THAT MANY COMPANIES HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED THEIR BREAK EVEN LEVELS OF OPERATIONS

 LOST WAGES SOME ECONOMISTS ARE DISMAYED AT THE LABOR DEPARTMENT'S PLANS TO DROP THE HOURLY EARNINGS INDEX FROM ITS MONTHLY EMPLOYMENT REPORT NEXT YEAR
 IT'S A FASHIONABLE NUMBER SAID MR. CHANDROSS OF LLOYD'S BANK NEW YORK
 ECONOMISTS ARE CURRENTLY FOCUSING ON THE INDEX TO GET A READING ON WAGE INFLATION
 THE LABOR DEPARTMENT WILL CONTINUE TO REPORT MONTHLY AGGREGATE DATA ON AVERAGE HOURLY EARNINGS
 BUT THE INDEX IS BEING REPLACED BY THE EMPLOYMENT COST SERIES
 ECONOMISTS SAID THE NEW INDEX HAS THE ADVANTAGE OF BEING A MORE RELIABLE READING AND THE DISADVANTAGE OF COMING OUT ONLY ONCE A QUARTER RATHER THAN EVERY MONTH
 HIGHER COMMISSIONS CAN ALSO REDUCE THE INVESTMENT VALUE OF LIFE INSURANCE POLICIES THAT INCLUDE A SAVINGS COMPONENT SUCH AS UNIVERSAL LIFE POLICIES
